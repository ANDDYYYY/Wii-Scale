# Wii-Scale

Wii-Scale turns your Wii Balance Board into a digital scale. Wii-Scale will automatically find your Wii Balance Board when you press the red sync button under it. All you have to do is just stand on it :) No boring console interface, watch your weight being calculated in realtime on a beautiful web insterface.

Wii-Scale is based on python and node.js and communicates with the lightning fast WebSocket protocol.

## Usage

Each time you whant to measure your weight you'll have to press the red sync button on your Wii Balance Board. The red sync button is located under the battery hatch. That's because it's a real hassle to pair it with your linux machine. Wii-Scale will stay on an listen for your Wii Balance Board and promt you what to do in the web interface.

The weight is calculated by taking the mean of 500 readings. There is also a safe period of 80 readings where you will step on the balance board that are skipped by default. All this to get the best accurate reading as possible. Oh, and all this will take about 3 seconds.

## Dependencies

To run Wii-Scale you'll need `Python 2` and `Node.js with npm installed`. Since Wii-Scale uses `BlueZ` bluetooth stack it's most likely it will only run on Linux.


### Install dependencies on Ubuntu

Python

	sudo apt-get install python
	sudo apt-get install python-pip

Node.js with npm

	sudo apt-get install nodejs


## Install Wii-Scale

For users: Go to Wii-Scales root folder and run:

	npm install --production
	python setup.py install

For developers: Go to Wii-Scales root folder and run:

	npm install
	python setup.py install

## Config (optional)

You can configure a different host, port, Wii Balance Board bluetooth address and calibration. If the scales weight is off by any amout you can calibrate it by your own by setting the calibration i Kg. So `npm config set wii-scale:calibrate 2`will add 2kg to your weight, default is set to 0.

	npm config set wii-scale:port 8080
	npm config set wii-scale:host localhost
	npm config set wii-scale:address 00:00:00:00:00
	npm config set wii-scale:calibrate 0

## Run


	npm start

Now the web server and Wii-Scale should be up and running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
