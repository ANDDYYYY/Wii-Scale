Runs Linux and works on your Raspberry Pi","body":"# Wii-Scale\r\n\r\nWii-Scale turns your Wii Balance Board into a digital scale. Wii-Scale will automatically find your Wii Balance Board when you press the red sync button under it. All you have to do is just stand on it :) No boring console interface, watch your weight being calculated in realtime on a beautiful web insterface.\r\n\r\n![Wii-Scale](https://github.com/aelveborn/Wii-Scale/blob/gh-pages/images/wiiscale_measuring.png?raw=true) \r\n\r\nWii-Scale is based on python and node.js and communicates with the lightning fast WebSocket protocol.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nEach time you whant to measure your weight you'll have to press the red sync button on your Wii Balance Board. The red sync button is located under the battery hatch. That's because it's a real hassle to pair it with your linux machine. Wii-Scale will stay on an listen for your Wii Balance Board and promt you what to do in the web interface.\r\n\r\n![Wii-Scale scanning for Wii Balance Board](https://github.com/aelveborn/Wii-Scale/blob/gh-pages/images/wiiscale_search.png?raw=true) \r\n\r\nThe weight is calculated by taking the mean of 500 readings. There is also a safe period of 80 readings where you will step on the balance board that are skipped by default. All this to get the best accurate reading as possible. Oh, and all this will take about 3 seconds.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nTo run Wii-Scale you'll need `Python 2` and `Node.js with npm installed`. Since Wii-Scale uses `BlueZ` bluetooth stack it's most likely it will only run on Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Install dependencies on Ubuntu\r\n\r\nPython\r\n\r\n\tsudo apt-get install python\r\n\tsudo apt-get install python-pip\r\n\r\nNode.js with npm\r\n\r\n\tsudo apt-get install nodejs\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install Wii-Scale\r\n\r\nGo to Wii-Scales root folder and run:\r\n\r\n\tnpm install\r\n\tpython setup.py install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Config (optional)\r\n\r\nYou can configure a different host, port, Wii Balance Board bluetooth address and calibration. If the scales weight is off by any amout you can calibrate it by your own by setting the calibration i Kg. So `npm config set wii-scale:calibrate 2`will add 2kg to your weight, default is set to 0.\r\n\r\n\tnpm config set wii-scale:port 8080\r\n\tnpm config set wii-scale:host localhost\r\n\tnpm config set wii-scale:address 00:00:00:00:00\r\n\tnpm config set wii-scale:calibrate 0\r\n\r\n## Run\r\n\r\n\r\n\tnpm start\r\n\r\nNow the web server and Wii-Scale should be up and running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\r\n\r\n## Libraries\r\n\r\nBased on the [wiiboard-simple](https://code.google.com/p/wiiboard-simple/) library.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Lincense\r\n\r\nWii-Scale is created and copyrighted by [Andreas Ã„lveborn](http://aelveborn.com) and lincensed under MIT.
